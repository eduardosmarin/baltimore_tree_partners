# Introduction

## Blue Water Baltimore

![](images/introduction_partner_org.png)

<p style="font-size:18px;">

[Blue Water Baltimore](https://bluewaterbaltimore.org/) is an environmental nonprofit based in the Greater Baltimore area. Their mission is to preserve and restore the quality of our region's waterways by working with communities, businesses, and organizations across the city. By protecting these vital resources, they foster a healthier environment, support the local economy through green spaces, and enhance community well-being. Their work spans a range of essential activities, including pollution investigation, trash cleanups, and water monitoring.

The following is an analysis of Blue Water Baltimore's tree giveaway program. This year-round initiative operates each spring and fall, focusing on Baltimore City and Baltimore County. The program aims to increase canopy coverage, with a particular emphasis on historically disenfranchised and under invested communities within the Greater Baltimore area.

## Data Background

### Origin

<p style="font-size:18px;">

The data was consolidated from various sources, including Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, and shapefiles spanning from 2013 to 2023. After extensive data wrangling, the information was successfully integrated into a single geodatabase, which we returned to Blue Water Baltimore.

This data reconciliation effort of Blue Water Baltimore is part of a broader discussion on data integrity and collaboration among partner organizations, such as TreeBaltimore, Baltimore City's urban and community forestry initiative, and Baltimore Tree Trust, an environmental nonprofit focused on urban forestry in Baltimore. Through these partnerships, we aim to facilitate seamless data sharing among organizations to address the region's environmental challenges more effectively.

</p>

### Topics

<p style="font-size:18px;">

There are five main topics of inquiry for this analysis:

-   *Location and time*

-   *Species*

-   *Watershed*

-   *JEDI: Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion*

-   [*Tapestry Groups*](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/esri-demographics/latest/regional-data/tapestry-segmentation.htm)

By focusing on these categories, the goal is to gain a clearer understanding of Blue Water Baltimore's tree distribution over the past decade. Additionally, this analysis aims to highlight key findings and meaningful contributions from Blue Water Baltimore, particularly regarding the environmental services it provides to our community.

This work builds on the foundation laid by Dexter H. Locke and Morgan Grove in their report, ["A Market Analysis of Opt-In Tree Planting and Rain Barrel Installation in Baltimore, MD, 2008â€“2012"](https://research.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/locke_morgan_2015_a_market_analysis_of_opt-in_tree_planting_and_rain_barrel_installation_in_baltimore_md_2008_-_2012.pdf)*,* and their peer-reviewed paper, ["Doing the hard work where it's easiest? Examining the relationships between urban greening programs and social and ecological characteristics."](#0)

Blue Water Baltimore has operated its tree giveaway service for over 15 years. In the past decade alone, between 2013 and 2023, they were able to give away `r scales::comma(round(nrow(blue_water_giveaway_data)))` trees.

One question that arises, however, is:

Where did these trees end up in Maryland?

This section aims to answer this question by examining the regions within Maryland, Baltimore County, and Baltimore City where tree giveaways were most heavily distributed. The analysis relies on the address information provided by applicants when requesting a tree. While this data offers insights into areas of the city where tree distribution occurred, it is important to acknowledge the potential for human error in the provided address information.

# 2. Making the heatmap with boundaries

   addPolygons(
    data = maryland_counties,
    color = "black",

    lat = ~st_coordinates(blue_water_giveaway_data)[,2],
    blur = 5, 
    max = 0.10,
    radius = 6,
    gradient = leaflet_colors(seq(0, 1, length.out = 10)) 
  )
 
```

<p style="font-size:18px;">

As anticipated, there is a high concentration of plantings in Baltimore County and Baltimore City over the past decade, with fewer plantings occurring in peripheral areas, including Howard, Anne Arundel, Carroll, and Harford counties.

<p style="font-size:18px;">

Giveaways are more common in the Spring than Fall Planting seasons except for 2015. Additionally, there is a general increase in giveaways over time.

Years to note:

-   In years 2018 and 2019, Blue Water Baltimore and TreeBaltimore partnered on their Fall giveaways. The data here is unusually high because they combined their counts together.

-   In year 2020, due to COVID-19 pandemic, there were no giveaways.

Naturally, as urban foresters, understanding the seasonal differences in plantings is also crucial! Analyzing data by season can provide insights into planting patterns and help refine strategies for future efforts.

</p>

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

As expected, there is generally a higher distribution of tree plantings
in the spring. However, the reasons behind this trend may be more
complex, involving a mixture of factors worth exploring:

1.  Are people more inclined to plant trees during the spring?

2.  Is there a larger supply of trees from nurseries during this season?

3.  What other factors might contribute to the high volume of spring
    plantings?

To investigate further, we can conduct surveys and perform regression
analyses to explore these questions in greater depth. Data visualization
is a powerful tool to prompt and begin answering research questions,
which we will get into later.

Continuing our preliminary analysis, we will categorize the plantings
into groups, specifically Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and neither.
This separation allows us to better understand the distribution and
trends in planting locations over time.

int_graph_tree_jur_plantings_over_years <-
  ggplotly(graph_tree_jur_plantings_over_years)

```

In addition to parsing giveaways by seasons per year, it is helpful to examine where the trees have gone over time, by jurisdiction. There were more giveaways in Baltimore City in years 2018 and 2019 than Baltimore County, largely due to the previously mentioned partnership with Tree Baltimore.

TODO: Add remark on recent trends after 2024 data

```{r echo=FALSE}
table_bwb_data <-
 blue_water_giveaway_data |> 
  st_drop_geometry() |> 
  group_by(jurisdiction) |> 
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = 'drop')
```

### Baltimore City and County

Baltimore City has a total of `r table_bwb_data |> filter(jurisdiction == "Baltimore City") |> pull(n)` tree planting from 2013 â€” 2023, while Baltimore County is not far off with `r table_bwb_data |> filter(jurisdiction == "Baltimore County") |> pull(n)`. We should take into consideration that Baltimore City has more households, and Baltimore County has more open space.

#### Tree Plantings per Household in Baltimore City and County per Block Group

```{r echo=FALSE}
# 1. Making the block group weighted density layer
tree_plantings_giveaway_cbg_weighted_layer <-
  cbg |>
  left_join(
      read_csv("../baltimore_tree_partners/output_data/census_count_year.csv")
    , by = "NAME"
  ) |>
  mutate(count = case_when(
    is.na(count) ~ 0,
    TRUE ~ count),
    Density = round(count/`households`, 3)
  ) |>
  dplyr::select(NAME,Density,count, households) |>
  rename(`Number of Giveaways` = count, `Households` = households, `Name` = NAME) |>
  filter(
    str_detect(Name, "Baltimore city") | str_detect(Name, "Baltimore County")
  )

# 2. Making the block group weighted legend
tree_plantings_giveaway_cbg_weighted_legend <- 
  classIntervals(
  tree_plantings_giveaway_cbg_weighted_layer$`Density`,
  n = 5, 
  style = "jenks"
)$brks #Empirical bayseing smoothing check it out

# 3. Making the neighborhood weighted map
(tree_giveaway_bcg_map <-
tree_plantings_giveaway_cbg_weighted_layer |>
  mapview(zcol = "Density", layer.name = "Tree Giveaways<br>per Household", at = tree_plantings_giveaway_cbg_weighted_legend
          , col.regions = rev(hcl.colors(5, palette = "viridis"))
          ) )

```

Census block groups have different sizes, shapes, and range of households. Therefore, we calculated the number of giveaways per household in each census block group to account for those differences. Lighter colors in the map indicate fewer trees per household while darker colors signify more trees per household. There are few block groups without any households shown in gray.

Northern parts of Baltimore City, around Harford Road, and near Towson have the most giveaways per household. Another apparent hotspot is around Catonsville and Ellicott City.

```

The number of giveaway trees per location varies, from `r unique_provider |> slice_min(n) |> pull(n)` at `r unique_provider |> slice_min(n) |> pull(giveaway_location)` to `r unique_provider |> slice_max(n) |> pull(n)` at `r unique_provider |> slice_max(n) |> pull(giveaway_location)`. The table below can be dynamically sorted and filtered.

#### Giveaway Locations by Count, Table

```{r echo=FALSE}

  rename("Number of Trees" = n, Percent = percent) |>
  mutate(Percent = round(100 * Percent, 2)) |>
  dplyr::select(-valid_percent) |>
  DT::datatable()
```

In the case of the amount of tree giveaway locations, the most giveaways originated at Stillmeadow Community Fellowship. **However, please note that `r unique(unique_provider_na$n)` trees or `r round(unique(unique_provider_na$percent), 2)`% do not have a giveaway location recorded.**

## Species

```{r include=FALSE}
colors_species <- c(
  "Serviceberry" = "#A52A2A",  
  "Sweetbay Magnolia" = "#8B4513",
  "Pawpaw" = "#D2691E",           
  "American Persimmon" = "#CD853F",
  "Common Fig" = "#DAA520",       
  "American Plum" = "#808000",    
  "American Holly" = "#6B8E23",   
  "Black Gum" = "#556B2F",        
  "Eastern Redbud" = "#4682B4",   
  "American Hornbeam" = "#8A2BE2" 
)
```

The following map highlights the top ten species given away from 2013 to 2023.

```

```{r echo=FALSE}

  mutate(percent = round(100 * percent, 2))
  
datatable_6_giveaway_top_10 <-
  datatable_6_giveaway |>
  slice(1:10)
```

There is no clear spatial pattern for the most popular species (in descending order of popularity): `r paste(datatable_6_giveaway_top_10$'Common Name'[1:9], collapse = ", ")`, and `r datatable_6_giveaway_top_10$'Common Name'[10]`. The most popular species for tree giveaways is `r datatable_6_giveaway_top_10$'Common Name'[1]`. Note many of these species are smaller, ornamental species, many of which provide fruit for wildlife.

Again, the following table can be sorted and filtered dynamically.

## Watersheds

Here is a general map of the watersheds in the Baltimore jurisdiction and Baltimore City region.

#### Watersheds in Blue Water Baltimore Service Area

```{r echo=FALSE}
jurisdiction_layer + watershed_layer

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#prepping for the statistic mentioned later
table_8_watershed_count <-
blue_water_giveaway_data |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  group_by(watershed) |>

  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  rename(Count = n) |>
  mutate(watershed = case_when(
    is.na(watershed) ~ "Outside BWB Service Area",
    TRUE ~ watershed
  ))
```

In terms of the plantings per watershed, these are the ones with the most ones in descending order: `r paste(paste(table_8_watershed_count$'watershed'[1:4], collapse = ", "), ", and ",table_8_watershed_count$'watershed'[5], sep = "")`. A special thing to notice is that there is a total of `r table_8_watershed_count |> filter('watershed' == "Outside BWB Service Area") |> pull(Count)` outside of Blue Water Baltimore Service's area. The following will show how this, relatively speaking, is a far lower margin that what we might previously have imagined.

## JEDI: Justice, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion

For this part of the analysis, we will look at income to see if it has any correlation with number of giveaways. In terms of the scale, we will look specifically at the census block group scale to determine this. We will first look at a synced map

### Income

```{r echo=FALSE}
## Making the legend breaks
legend_order_census_income_count <- 
  seq(0, 200000, length.out = 6) 

## Making the census-income map
census_income_map <-
  cbg |>
  dplyr::select(-county) |>
  separate(NAME, into = c("Block Group","Census Tract","County","State"), sep = ", ") |>
  filter(County %in% c("Baltimore city","Baltimore County")) |>
  rename("Median Household Income" = median_household_income) |>
  mapview(zcol = "Median Household Income", layer.name = "Median Household<br>Income", at = legend_order_census_income_count, col.regions = rev(hcl.colors(5, palette = "viridis")))

## The Sync Map of Count and Income
sync(census_income_map, tree_giveaway_bcg_map, ncol = 1)

data_regression_income_graph <-
  cbg |> 
  left_join(tree_plantings_giveaway_cbg_weighted_layer |> st_drop_geometry(), by = c("NAME" = "Name")
  )

correlation_income_household_count <-
data_regression_income_graph %$% 
  cor.test(median_household_income, Density) |> 
  broom::tidy() |>
  mutate_if(is.double, round, 3)
```

The spatial association between giveaways per household and income is not strong. There is apparent relationship from these maps. Statistically, the relationship is also weak (`r correlation_income_household_count$estimate`) but significant (p-value = `r correlation_income_household_count$p.value`), as shown below in the scatterplot with a linear regression.

#### Regression Income Graph of Income and Count per Household

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

regression_income_count_graph <- 
  data_regression_income_graph |>
  ggplot(aes(x = median_household_income, y = Density)) +

  geom_smooth(color = "#519342", method = "lm", se = TRUE) + 
  labs(
    x = "Median Household Income", 
    y = "Giveaway Count per Household"
  ) +

  ggplot(aes(x = median_household_income, y = year, fill = factor(..quantile..))) +
  stat_density_ridges(
    quantiles = c(0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8),
    quantile_lines = TRUE,
    geom = "density_ridges_gradient",
    alpha = 0.6,
    scale = 2.3
  ) + 
  scale_fill_viridis(
    discrete = TRUE,
    name = "Quantile",
    alpha = 0.3,
    option = "mako"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    labels = scales::dollar_format(),
    breaks = seq(0, 275000, by = 50000)
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Median Household Income",
    y = "Year"
  )  +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#FAFAF9", color = "#FAFAF9"),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#FAFAF9", color = "#FAFAF9"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14), 
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
    legend.title = element_text(size = 14), 
    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)
  )

gg_ridgeline_income_year_graph


```

We can also visualize giveaway counts versus income per year. The above is a ridgeline graph showing the distribution of giveaways versus median household income. Lumps to the right indicate higher incomes while lumps to the left indicate lower income. Overall, the median (quantile 3) is shifting left and the distribution is becoming more equitable.

## Tapestry

### General

Rather than analyze a single socio-demographic or economic variable like median household income, it can be useful to categorize places based on multiple dimensions simultaneously. Geo-demographic market segmentation is a suite of techniques ideally suited categorizing neighborhoods or Census block groups. Briefly, multiple characteristics are clustered to form these categories. Although not all individuals will match the profile exactly, the average would be similar to the tapestry level described. The geo-demographic dataset we used here is through Esri's Tapestry.

# Conclusion

This preliminary analysis of over a decade of Blue Water Baltimoreâ€™s tree giveaway data reveals significant trends in Baltimore City and Baltimore County. By investigating patterns in tree distribution across locations, species, watershed areas, and socioeconomic factors, we gain valuable insights into the programâ€™s impact on promoting equitable urban forestry. Ongoing collaboration with our partner organization, Blue Water Baltimore, aims to refine this data and integrate it into an expanded webpage featuring similar data-driven infographics to improve public understanding and engagement.
