# Introduction

## Presenters

![](images/introduction_presenters-10.png)

<p style="font-size:18px;">

Eduardo Marin, an intern with the USDA Forest Service Baltimore Field Station, worked under the leadership of Dexter Locke, a research geographer with the USDA Forest Service Baltimore Field Station, to prepare the presentation, reconcile the data, and perform preliminary analysis for Blue Water Baltimore.

</p>

## Partner Organization

![](images/introduction_partner_org.png)

<p style="font-size:18px;">

Blue Water Baltimore, our partner organization for the project, is an environmental nonprofit based in the Greater Baltimore area. Their mission is to preserve and restore the quality of our region's waterways by working with communities, businesses, and organizations across the city. By protecting these vital resources, they foster a healthier environment, support the local economy through green spaces, and enhance community well-being. Their work spans a range of essential activities, including pollution investigation, trash cleanups, and water monitoring.

As part of the project and partnership, we analyzed Blue Water Baltimore's tree giveaway program. This year-round initiative operates each spring and fall, focusing on Baltimore City and Baltimore County. The program aims to increase canopy coverage, with a particular emphasis on historically disenfranchised and under invested communities within the Greater Baltimore area.

## Data Background

### Origin

<p style="font-size:18px;">

The data was consolidated from various sources, including Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, and shapefiles spanning from 2013 to 2023. After extensive data wrangling, the information was successfully integrated into a single geodatabase, forming the basis of today's analysis.

This data reconciliation effort with Blue Water Baltimore is part of a broader discussion on data integrity and collaboration among partner organizations, such as TreeBaltimore, Baltimore City's urban and community forestry initiative, and Baltimore Tree Trust, an environmental nonprofit focused on urban forestry in Baltimore. Through this partnership, we aim to facilitate seamless data sharing among organizations to address the region's environmental challenges more effectively.

</p>

### Topics

<p style="font-size:18px;">

There are five main topics of inquiry for this analysis:

-   *Location and time*

-   *Species*

-   *Watershed*

-   *JEDI*

-   *Tapestry*

By focusing on these categories, the goal is to gain a clearer understanding of Blue Water Baltimore's tree distribution over the past decade. Additionally, this analysis aims to highlight key findings and meaningful contributions from Blue Water Baltimore, particularly regarding the environmental services it provides to our community.

This work builds on the foundation laid by Dexter H. Locke and Morgan Grove in their paper, [*"A Market Analysis of Opt-In Tree Planting and Rain Barrel Installation in Baltimore, MD, 2008–2012."*](https://research.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/locke_morgan_2015_a_market_analysis_of_opt-in_tree_planting_and_rain_barrel_installation_in_baltimore_md_2008_-_2012.pdf){target="_blank"}

<p style="font-size:18px;">

Blue Water Baltimore has operated its tree giveaway service for over 15 years. In the past decade alone, between 2013 and 2023, they were able to give away approximately `r scales::comma(round(nrow(blue_water_giveaway_data)))` trees.

One question that arises, however, is: Where did these trees end up in Maryland?

This section aims to answer this question by examining the regions within Maryland, Baltimore County, and Baltimore City where tree giveaways were most heavily distributed. The analysis relies on the address information provided by applicants when requesting a tree. While this data offers insights into areas of the city where tree distribution occurred, it is important to acknowledge the potential for human error in the provided address information.

    weight = 2,
    opacity = 0.05,

  )
```

<p style="font-size:18px;">

As anticipated, there is a high concentration of plantings in Baltimore County and Baltimore City over the past decade, with fewer plantings occurring in peripheral areas, including Howard, Anne Arundel, Carroll, and Harford counties.

Some notable years are the following:

-   2018 — Partnership with TreeBaltimore and data management

-   2019 — Partnership with TreeBaltimore and data management

-   2020 — COVID-19

Naturally, as urban foresters, understanding the seasonal differences in plantings is also crucial! Analyzing data by season can provide insights into planting patterns and help refine strategies for future efforts.

</p>

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

As expected, there is generally a higher distribution of tree plantings
in the spring. However, the reasons behind this trend may be more
complex, involving a mixture of factors worth exploring:

1.  Are people more inclined to plant trees during the spring?

2.  Is there a larger supply of trees from nurseries during this season?

3.  What other factors might contribute to the high volume of spring
    plantings?

To investigate further, we can conduct surveys and perform regression
analyses to explore these questions in greater depth. Data visualization
is a powerful tool to prompt and begin answering research questions,
which we will get into later.

Continuing our preliminary analysis, we will categorize the plantings
into groups, specifically Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and neither.
This separation allows us to better understand the distribution and
trends in planting locations over time.

### Giveaway Location

```{r include=FALSE}
# 1. Making the data frame of the providers
unique_provider <-
 blue_water_giveaway_data |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  tabyl(giveaway_location) |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  slice(-1) 

# 2. Finding the providers not included
unique_provider_na <- 
 blue_water_giveaway_data |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  tabyl(giveaway_location) |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  slice(1)  |>
  mutate(percent = 100*percent)

```

In terms of giveaway location, there are approximately `r nrow(unique_provider)` different giveaway locations over the last ten years. Each of them vary, especially in terms of amount.

#### Giveaway Locations by Count, Table

```{r echo=FALSE}
#1. Making the table of the giveaway_data
  blue_water_giveaway_data |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  tabyl(giveaway_location) |> 
  rename(`Giveaway Location` = giveaway_location) |>
  as_tibble() |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  slice(-1) |> 
  rename("Number of Trees" = n, Percent = percent) |>
  mutate(Percent = round(100 * Percent, 2)) |>
  dplyr::select(-valid_percent) |>
  DT::datatable()
```

In the case of the amount of tree giveaway locations, the most stems from Stillmeadow Community Fellowship. However, please understand that the a large percentage are undefined, totaling `r unique(unique_provider_na$n)`. This approximately accounts for `r unique(unique_provider_na$percent)`% of the dataset.

#### Giveaway Locations by Count, Bar Graph

```{r echo=FALSE}

    axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
    legend.title = element_text(size = 14), 
    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)
  ) +
    NULL

## Species

```{r include=FALSE}
colors_species <- c(
  "Serviceberry" = "#A52A2A",  
  "Sweetbay Magnolia" = "#8B4513",
  "Pawpaw" = "#D2691E",           
  "American Persimmon" = "#CD853F",
  "Common Fig" = "#DAA520",       
  "American Plum" = "#808000",    
  "American Holly" = "#6B8E23",   
  "Black Gum" = "#556B2F",        
  "Eastern Redbud" = "#4682B4",   
  "American Hornbeam" = "#8A2BE2" 
)
```

The following map highlights the top ten species giveaway in the jurisdiction.

#### Top 10 Species Giveaway, Map

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Pulling top 10 species
species_order <- 
  blue_water_giveaway_data |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  count(common_name) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  slice(1:10) |>
  pull(common_name)

blue_water_giveaway_data |>
mutate(common_name = case_when(
  common_name %in% species_order ~ common_name,
  TRUE ~ NA_character_
)) |>
filter(!is.na(common_name)) |>
mutate(common_name = factor(common_name, levels = species_order)) |>
dplyr::select(year, season, common_name, genus_species) |>
mapview(
zcol = "common_name",
col.regions = colors_species,
layer.name = "Top 10 Tree Species"
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#Prepping for the next data frame
datatable_6_giveaway <-
blue_water_giveaway_data |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  tabyl(common_name) |>
  rename(`Common Name` = common_name) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  mutate(percent = round(100 * percent, 2))
  
datatable_6_giveaway_top_10 <-
  datatable_6_giveaway |>
  slice(1:10)
```

As you can see, there is no clear spatial pattern for the most popular species (in descending order): `r paste(datatable_6_giveaway_top_10$'Common Name'[1:9], collapse = ", ")`, and `r datatable_6_giveaway_top_10$'Common Name'[10]`. The most popular species for tree giveaways is `r datatable_6_giveaway_top_10$'Common Name'[1]`. Investing more time and energy into securing this species may be worthwhile for future tree giveaways.

The following table will show you more in-depth the breakdown of the different types of species given away.

#### Species per Giveaway, Table

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Table 6. Table of the Species for the Giveaways
  datatable_6_giveaway |>
  rename(Count = n) |>
  DT::datatable()
```

In the case here, this visually displays the same information, highlighting how distinct the most common and least common species are in the amount of species give away.

#### Top 10 Species per Jurisdiction, Bar Graph

```{r echo=FALSE}
#TODO: Dexter, need help since I cannot make arranged descending

# 1. Static graph of jurisdiction
graph_jurisdiction_top_species <- 
  blue_water_giveaway_data |> 
  st_drop_geometry() |>

  inner_join(
    blue_water_giveaway_data |> 
      st_drop_geometry() |> 
      rename(`Common Name` = common_name) |> 
      group_by(jurisdiction, `Common Name`) |> 
      summarize(Total = n(), .groups = 'drop'), 
    by = "Common Name"
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    `Common Name` = fct_reorder(`Common Name`, Overall_Total, .desc = TRUE) 
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(y = `Common Name`, x = Total, fill = jurisdiction)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +  
  scale_fill_manual(values = jurisdiction_colors) + 
  labs(
    y = "Common Name", 
    x = "Total Number of Trees", 
    fill = "Jurisdiction"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", color = NA), 
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", color = NA), 
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14), 
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
    legend.title = element_text(size = 14), 
    legend.text = element_text(size = 12)
  )

# 2. Graph of jurisdictions
int_graph_jurisdiction_top_species <-
  ggplotly(graph_jurisdiction_top_species)

int_graph_jurisdiction_top_species

```

Again, it is also important to understand what were the most popular species given during each time of the year.

## Watersheds

To begin, here is a general map of the watersheds in the Baltimore jurisdiction and Baltimore City region.

#### Watersheds in Blue Water Baltimore Service Area, Map

```{r echo=FALSE}
jurisdiction_layer + watershed_layer
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#prepping for the statistic mentioned later
table_8_watershed_count <-
blue_water_giveaway_data |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  group_by(watershed) |>
  count() |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  rename(Count = n) |>
  mutate(watershed = case_when(
    is.na(watershed) ~ "Outside BWB Service Area",
    TRUE ~ watershed
  ))
```

In terms of the plantings per watershed, these are the ones with the most ones in descending order: `r paste(paste(table_8_watershed_count$'watershed'[1:4], collapse = ", "), ", and ",table_8_watershed_count$'watershed'[5], sep = "")`. A special thing to notice is that there is a total of `r table_8_watershed_count |> filter('watershed' == "Outside BWB Service Area") |> pull(Count)` outside of Blue Water Baltimore Service's area. The following will show how this, relatively speaking, is a far lower margin that what we might previously have imagined.

#### Watersheds per Giveaway Count, Table

```{r echo=FALSE}
table_8_watershed_count_datatable <-
  blue_water_giveaway_data |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  tabyl(watershed) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  mutate(percent = round(100 * percent, 2)) |>
  rename(Count = n, Percent = percent) |>
  mutate(watershed = case_when(
    is.na(watershed) ~ "Outside BWB Service Area",
    TRUE ~ watershed
  )) |>
  rename(Watershed = watershed)

table_8_watershed_count_datatable |>
DT::datatable()
```

Besides understanding the breakdown of each watershed by season, it is also important to understand the breakdown overall. In the following graph, it will highlight the total amount of plantings in each watershed per year.

## JEDI: Justice, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion

We will first begin looking at income to see if there is any correlation between that and the number of giveaways. In terms of the scale, we will look specifically at the census block scale to determine this. We will first look at a synced map

### Income

```{r echo=FALSE}
## Making the legend breaks
legend_order_census_income_count <- 
  seq(0, 200000, length.out = 6) 

## Making the census-income map
census_income_map <-
  cbg |>
  dplyr::select(-county) |>
  separate(NAME, into = c("Block Group","Census Tract","County","State"), sep = ", ") |>
  filter(County %in% c("Baltimore city","Baltimore County")) |>
  rename("Median Household Income" = median_household_income) |>
  mapview(zcol = "Median Household Income", layer.name = "Median Household<br>Income", at = legend_order_census_income_count)

## The Sync Map of Count and Income
sync(census_income_map, census_count_map, ncol = 1)

```

The spatial association between giveaways per household and income is not strong. Statistically, the relationship is also weak.

#### Regression Income Graph of Income and Count

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
regression_income_count_graph <- 
  cbg |> 
  left_join(
    read_csv("../baltimore_tree_partners/output_data/census_count_year.csv"),

    x = "Median Household Income", 
    y = "Giveaway Count"
  ) +

# Conclusion

This preliminary analysis of over a decade of Blue Water Baltimore’s tree giveaway data reveals significant trends in Baltimore City and Baltimore County. By investigating patterns in tree distribution across locations, species, watershed areas, and socioeconomic factors, we gain valuable insights into the program’s impact on promoting equitable urban forestry. Ongoing collaboration with our partner organization, Blue Water Baltimore, aims to refine this data and integrate it into an expanded webpage featuring similar data-driven infographics to improve public understanding and engagement.
